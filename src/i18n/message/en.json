Each egg coffee, flat white, or iced matcha is made deliberately, balancing aroma, flavor, and the feeling you take with you after leaving. We built a small stop where you can drop in, linger long enough to watch a train roll by, talk with your companion, or finish a few lines of work. Every detail—from the menu and lighting to the seats by the tracks—is designed to make you feel welcomed and more connected to this city and to each other."
